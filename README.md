# Motivation

After writing the simple script to that allows the user to search the top results given by Indeed.com
according to given search terms and location collected in the terminal, I decided to create a GUI for 
easier data collection using the MVC design pattern. The end result of the project will be an executable 
that can be placed on a desktop for easy searching of jobs.

This project has tested me and helped develop my skills not only in becoming a Pythonic programmer, 
but also in software development practices, i.e. using Git to track my progress, and implementing the 
MVC design pattern.

### Installation and Usage:
1. Clone repository.
2. Run the file: `install_requirements.sh`
3. In your terminal, navigate to the root directory.
